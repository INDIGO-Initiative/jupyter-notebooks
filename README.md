# INDIGO Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains a set of Jupyter Notebooks to get and do various things with the data from the [INDIGO project](https://golab.bsg.ox.ac.uk/knowledge-bank/indigo/).

## Google Colab

We use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run these notebooks. This is a free service anyone with a Google account can use. The instructions given here are for using this service.

However, if you prefer to run [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) yourself or use another hosted service this should be possible.

## To run an existing notebook

Select the notebook you want from the list below. Press the button to open the notebook yourself. This will open the notebook, but you will not yet be able to save any changes you make. If you make changes and want to save them, make sure you go to the `File` menu and select `Save a copy in Drive`.
