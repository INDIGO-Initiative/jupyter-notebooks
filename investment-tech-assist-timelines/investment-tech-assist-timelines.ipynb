By comparing the `investment-timelines` visualization, we can see that the `investment-timelines` visualization is approximately 257K USD and when the cost of technical assistance is added (as shown here), the total investment to support the SOC is 281K USD, showing the in-kind cost of TA at 24K USD. (BII has calculated their technical assistance ‘cost’ at a proxy rate of £565 per day for the Pyramid Project (INDIGO-POJ-0194) project. This has been taken as an estimated rate using a contract awarded to Traverse22 for their provision of TA as a benchmark. Rates for technical assistance will vary widely in the sector across social investors and intermediaries, e.g. many intermediaries would charge £700-£1200 per day for senior ‘Director level’ support to projects. BII is still iterating for the most accurate proxy day rates for the provision of technical assistance and improving accuracy of measuring technical assistance days.  "

We have a system for processing information and try to attribute data to named sources, but we do not audit, cross-check, or verify all information provided to us. It takes time and resources to share data, which may not have been included in a project’s budget. Many of the projects are ongoing and timely updates may not be available. Different people may have different interpretations of data items and definitions. Even when data are high quality, interpretation or generalisation to different contexts may not be possible and/or requires additional information and/or expertise.
