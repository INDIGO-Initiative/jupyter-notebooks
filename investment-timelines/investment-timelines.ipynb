Negative values indicate a net flow of capital from the investor to the project provider. Positive values indicate flow of capital/returns paid to the investor.

        "Therefore, this visualisation represents the behavior of the investment timeline in a live project (from the perspective of a social investor). At the beginning of the project, we can observe that the value of investment is negative: this means that the social investor has invested some resource (either debt or equity) and has not started to be repaid yet. As time goes by and outcomes are achieved, the investor starts to receive some return. We expect the line to go up every time the provider repays either capital or interest to the investor. This is usually aligned to when outcomes are expected to be achieved by the provider but outcomes payments are not shown directly on this visualization. \n",

This visualization shows that for the Street Impact Brighton project, 2 ½ years into a 3-year project the investor has not yet been fully repaid.  \n",

        "As this is a live project the expected J-curve over the investment timeline is incomplete. One limitation of this visualization is that it focuses on the financial return which does not show the full picture for a social investor who has to consider both risk and return of impact alongside the financial. For example, a project would not be considered ‘successful’ if the financial investment was returned above the initial value of capital invested but this was to the detriment of anticipated impact to be achieved."

These data are NOT shared for auditing, investment, or legal purposes. Please independently verify any data that you might use in decision making. We provide no guarantees or assurances as to the quality of these data. Data may be inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, and/or not current for various reasons: INDIGO is a collaborative and iterative initiative that mostly relies on projects all over the world volunteering to share their data. We have a system for processing information and try to attribute data to named sources, but we do not audit, cross-check, or verify all information provided to us. It takes time and resources to share data, which may not have been included in a project’s budget. Many of the projects are ongoing and timely updates may not be available. Different people may have different interpretations of data items and definitions. Even when data are high quality, interpretation or generalisation to different contexts may not be possible and/or requires additional information and/or expertise.
